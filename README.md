# [Static Comp Challenge](https://ivonne-hernandez.github.io/static-comp-challenge/)
The goal of this project was to recreate a static comp using HTML and CSS. No assets were provided. The site was required to be responsive from 1440px to 320px browser widths and required to look the same on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.
